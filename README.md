# Langchain Customer Support

This project is built with [Adonis.js](https://adonisjs.com/) in order to create a customer service bot that takes audio input and responds in audio.

Current progress:
- [x] Speech-to-text transcription is done via OpenAI.
- [x] A conversational agent using `Langchain` is implemented.
- [x] CRUD operations for `Conversation` and `ConversationItem` models are in place.
- [ ] Server can take audio files directly to be transcribed.
- [ ] Server can take audio file inputs, transcribe them, pass them to the chat and respond to it in text.
- [ ] Server can now respond with audio as well.
